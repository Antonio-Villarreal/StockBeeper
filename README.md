# StockBeeper

Entry 1- August 2021 : Began developing the initial demo of the product with very simple, rudamentary concepts to test if the idea could work. Focused on accessing the stock data and displaying that through a frontend. Program lacked the whole text notification system. The program is able to take in a ticker symbol input from the user and display the current price of that stock which allows the user to determine what limits they want to set. The limit lists are sorted so that the closest one to the current value is at the top of the list and displayed at the top of the list. In addition, you can type in new Ticker symbols to overwrite/delete old progress so that you ca work with a new stock.
